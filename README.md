Development Project: Privacy-Preserving Biometric Authentication (PPBA) System Overview

This repository contains the final development project for the university course on advanced security systems. The project focuses on a Privacy-Preserving Biometric Authentication (PPBA) system designed to enhance security and privacy in biometric data handling using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). My system enables secure biometric authentication without compromising the user's privacy, making it ideal for applications requiring high security and confidentiality.

Key Features

Biometric Data Encryption: Utilises state-of-the-art Fully Homomorphic Encryption to ensure that biometric data remains encrypted throughout the processing pipeline, from data capture to authentication.
User Privacy Preservation: Designed with privacy at its core, the system ensures that biometric data is never exposed or accessible in its raw form, safeguarding user privacy against potential breaches.

Flexible Biometric Processing: Supports various biometric modalities, including fingerprints and facial recognition, providing a versatile authentication framework.
Secure Data Storage: Encrypted biometric data is securely stored, ensuring that even in the event of unauthorised database access, user privacy is not compromised.

High Scalability: Engineered for scalability, the system can be easily adapted to serve a wide range of applications, from small-scale projects to large, enterprise-level deployments.

Technical Foundation

The PPBA system is built on Python, leveraging the TenSEAL library for implementing FHE operations. This project demonstrates the practical application of advanced cryptographic techniques to real-world security challenges, showcasing the feasibility of privacy-preserving biometric authentication.
